# Human-Activity-Recognization

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Project
This project aims to recognize and classify human activities based on sensor data using machine learning techniques. It utilizes data from accelerometers and gyroscopes in smartphones to detect activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and more.

## 🧠 Project Overview
- Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a key problem in fields like healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments. In this project, we:

- Collected or used a pre-existing HAR dataset

- Preprocessed and cleaned the data

- Built and trained machine learning and/or deep learning models

- Evaluated the model’s performance

- Visualized results

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

- Activity classification using ML/DL models

- Accuracy and performance visualization

- Support for adding new datasets and activity types

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the UCI HAR Dataset (or mention your own dataset if used). It includes data from smartphone sensors collected from multiple subjects performing daily activities.
- Activities classified:

- Walking

  - Walking Upstairs

  - Walking Downstairs

- Sitting

- Standing

- Laying

 ## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python

- NumPy, Pandas

- Scikit-learn

- TensorFlow / Keras (if deep learning used)

- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

- Jupyter Notebook (for experiments)

## 📈 Model Performance
- Model	Accuracy
- Logistic Regression	89.5%
- Random Forest	93.2%
- LSTM (Deep Learning)	95.6%

(Note: Replace these with your actual results)

## 📊 Results
- Confusion matrix

- Accuracy and loss plots

- Activity classification report
